# Optimal Trading Strategy

This strategy is designed for a manual trading system where you start with **500 SeaShells** and use a series of exchanges between SeaShells, Snowballs, and Silicon Nuggets to steadily increase your total SeaShells.

## Overview

You can profitably cycle your trades by following the path:
**SeaShells → Snowballs → Silicon Nuggets → SeaShells**

Each complete cycle yields a net multiplier of approximately **1.03823**, meaning you gain about **3.82%** per cycle. Repeating the cycle compounds your SeaShells over time.

## Conversion Factors

For your reference, the conversion rates are as follows:

- **SeaShells → Snowballs:** Multiply by **1.34**
- **Snowballs → Silicon Nuggets:** Multiply by **0.52**
- **Silicon Nuggets → SeaShells:** Multiply by **1.49**

## Step-by-Step Strategy

1. **Start with 500 SeaShells.**

2. **Convert SeaShells to Snowballs:**
   - Multiply your SeaShells by **1.34**.
   - Calculation: `500 SeaShells × 1.34 = 670 Snowballs`.

3. **Convert Snowballs to Silicon Nuggets:**
   - Multiply your Snowballs by **0.52**.
   - Calculation: `670 Snowballs × 0.52 = 348.4 Silicon Nuggets`.

4. **Convert Silicon Nuggets back to SeaShells:**
   - Multiply your Silicon Nuggets by **1.49**.
   - Calculation: `348.4 Silicon Nuggets × 1.49 ≈ 519.12 SeaShells`.

5. **Repeat the Cycle:**
   - Your new starting amount is roughly **519.12 SeaShells**.
   - Each cycle multiplies your SeaShells by approximately **1.03823**.
   - For example:
     - After 1 cycle: ~519.12 SeaShells
     - After 2 cycles: ~538.97 SeaShells
     - After 3 cycles: ~559.44 SeaShells
     - And so on.

## Key Points

- **Compounding Effect:** Although the increase per cycle is modest (3.82%), repeated cycles amplify the total returns.
- **Manual Trading:** Ensure you track each trade carefully. You might want to use a simple calculator or a spreadsheet to keep a record of your compounded gains.
- **Optimal Choice:** This cycle avoids low conversion factors found in other trade paths (such as using Pizza's as an intermediate) that can result in losses.

## Final Thoughts

This optimal trading strategy leverages a repeatable and compounding cycle that is designed to increase your SeaShells over time. By following the **SeaShells → Snowballs → Silicon Nuggets → SeaShells** loop, you optimize your trades and maximize your returns.

Happy Trading!
